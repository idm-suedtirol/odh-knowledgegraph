\subsection{Fact description:}

The dimensions are defined, as: Student, Date, State, and Event. The Events fact has no descriptive attributes, it only contains the surrogate keys of all the dimensions.
As for the structure of our fact schema and the logic behind it there was no need to include any advanced concepts such as multiple arcs, convergences or a shared hierarchy.

\subsection{Bus Matrix}
	
Having only one business process there would be no use of a Bus Matrix because all of our dimensions are exclusively used by that one business process.
